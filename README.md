# Coroutines_and_Concurrency
Implementation of David Beazley's loosely coupled coroutines that allow for multi-tasking and concurrency. Coroutines are meant to allow a single thread to multi-task, which is useful when you need iteration as a method for producing data, receiving messages as a consumer, or a trap for cooperative multitasking.
